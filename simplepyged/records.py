class Line:
    """ Line of a GEDCOM file

    Each line in a Gedcom file has following format:

    level [xref] tag [value]

    where level and tag are required, and xref and value are optional.
    Lines are arranged hierarchically according to their level, and
    lines with a level of zero (called 'records') are at the top
    level.  Lines with a level greater than zero are children of their
    parent.

    A xref has the format @pname@, where pname is any sequence of
    characters and numbers.  The xref identifies the record being
    referenced to, so that any xref included as the value of any line
    points back to the original record.  For example, an line may have
    a FAMS tag whose value is @F1@, meaning that this line points to
    the family record in which the associated individual is a spouse.
    Likewise, an line with a tag of FAMC has a value that points to a
    family record in which the associated individual is a child.
    
    See a Gedcom file for examples of tags and their values.
